## **Quick Test Commands**

### **Browser Console Testing:**

// Test responsive breakpoints
window.innerWidth // Check current width
document.querySelector('nav').classList // Check navigation classes
```

### **Accessibility Testing:**
```javascript
// Check ARIA labels
document.querySelectorAll('[aria-current="page"]') // Active navigation item
document.querySelector('[role="navigation"]') // Navigation container
